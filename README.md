This software works with Decawave DWM1000 tags connected to the arduino mini pro. It automatically creates
network of tags, some of them T_STATIC with known coordinates and some are T_MOVING. Last ones collect
information from static tags, tries to calculate its position and reports it through modbus-compatible
data packets on serial interface to external devices.
